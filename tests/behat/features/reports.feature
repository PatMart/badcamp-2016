Feature: Reports of activities.
  In order to manage the conference
  As an organizer
  I need to be able to see reports on user activities.
#
#  Scenario: Organizers can see attendee lists and count.
#    Given I am logged in as an "Organizer"
#    When I visit "/organizer"
#    Then I should see "Displaying"
